                <h3>You needed a place like home, so we moved back home</h3>
                <p>It was 2015. Two erstwhile IIM-A hostel roomies, Anindya and Sandeep, met again. Reminiscing about the 'good old hostel days', they realised a lot of that 'good' could've been better. So to give youngsters that 'better', in 2017, they set up a base in New Delhi, and the rest, as we say, is the present.</p>
